Python is a multipurpose  language.
By using python language we can do anything.
Python can also be used Game development.
So, By using python can create a simple game i.e., rock-scissors-paper.
Actually it is a "hand game" for two or more players. Participants say "rock, paper, scissors" and then simulataneously from their hands
into the shape of a rock (fist), a piece of paper (palm), pair of scissors (two fingers).
How it works means,
if rock vs scissors --> rock wins ( rock smashes scissors ),
if scissors vs paper --> scissors wins ( scissor cut the paper ),
if paper vs rock --> paper wins (paper covers rock ) and 
if user_input and computer_input both are same then it's tie!,
this is the game concept.
First we can take options are rock, scissor, paper.
In this gane we can use one randint() inbuilt function, it picks the numbers randomly from given range.
